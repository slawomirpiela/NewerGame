### Description

_Currently a single player game created for my OOP project._

**Player currently is able to**

- Start a game
- Change the difficulty (coming soon)
- Use the mouse to control a racket
- Hit the ball with the racket in order to destroy all of the bricks "mobs"
- Ball changes direction everytime it hits a wall/mob/racket as close to natural movements as I could
- Player has 3 lives: 3 balls, which appear one after another once he/she misses a ball as it's coming down
- Player gets points for every mob killed
- A leaderboard of player scores (coming soon)
